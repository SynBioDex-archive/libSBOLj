/**
 * The SBOL data model's SequenceAnnotation for RDF and Json.
 *
 * Sequence Annotations give the location and direction of SequenceFeatures of
 * a DnaComponent. The location is specified by the start and stop positions of
 * the Sequence Feature along the DNA sequence. We are using the convention that
 * the first base pair of a DNA sequence is position 1. This convention is
 * established by the broader Molecular biology community, in literature.
 * The direction of the feature is specified by the strand [+/-]. Sequences used
 * are by convention assumed 5' to 3', therefore the <code>+</code> strand is
 * 5' to 3' and the <code>-</code> strand is 3' to 5'.
